        <p>Covid-19 deaths in the country crossed 10,000 in the country on Thursday as the government reported 94 more
            virus deaths.

            A total of 10,081 deaths were reported in the country so far. Death toll in the country crossed 9,000 on 31
            March.

            The number of detected coronavirus cases in Bangladesh, according to the government, on Thursday rose to
            707,362 as 4,192 more cases were reported in the last 24 hours, said a press release of Directorate General
            of Health Services (DGHS).</p>

            <h2>Use Covid-19 lessons to battle deadly superbugs: WHO</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/w.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Lessons learned during the Covid-19 pandemic should be used to fight the spread of drug-resistant
                bacteria, which kill tens of thousands of people each year, the World Health Organization (WHO) said
                Thursday.

                The UN health agency warned that the world was running out of options for fighting so-called superbugs,
                with few new effective antibiotics in the pipeline.

                But it said that the coronavirus crisis, which had dramatically deepened the global understanding of the
                health and economic implications of an uncontrolled pandemic, could spur progress.

                The worldwide push to rein in the pandemic had proven that rapid progress can be made when there is
                enough political will, the WHO pointed out.</p>

                <h2>Containing Covid difficult when asymptomatic carriers are unidentified</h2>
                <img src="assets/img/p.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Public health experts have expressed concern as negligence by asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus
                    puts their neighbours at risk of being infected. They believe that efforts to reduce the spread of
                    Covid-19 will be even more challenging unless asymptomatic carriers are identified soon.

                    On 14 April, Bangladesh witnessed as many as 96 Covid-19 deaths, the highest since 18 March 2020
                    when the first coronavirus death was announced in the country. The government had imposed a
                    seven-day ‘strict’ lockdown on the very day. Public health experts have blamed people’s sheer
                    negligence of health safety guidelines for the surge of Covid-19 deaths.

                    Mushtaq Husain, adviser to the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control And Research (IEDCR), tells
                    Prothom Alo that the impact of the ongoing ‘strict’ lockdown would be visible after three weeks.

                    “Impact of any health restriction to contain coronavirus transmission can be assessed after two
                    weeks of its imposition, because the incubation period of this particular virus is two-weeks,” says.
